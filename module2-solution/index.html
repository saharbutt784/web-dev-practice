      <p>
        A Turkish specialty made from hand-minced lamb blended with chili
        flakes, herbs, and spices, then molded onto skewers and charcoal-grilled

    <div class="section" id="section3">
      <div class="section-title" id="title3">Chicken Biryani</div>
      <p>
        An iconic South Asian delicacy, Biryani is a royal blend of long-grain
        basmati rice and tender pieces of marinated meat or vegetables, layered
        with caramelized onions, saffron, fresh herbs, and a unique mix of
        aromatic spices. Slow-cooked in a sealed pot (dum-style) to lock in
        flavor and fragrance, each bite offers a perfect harmony of richness and
        depth. Served with cooling raita or tangy salan, this dish is a complete
        and satisfying culinary experience.
